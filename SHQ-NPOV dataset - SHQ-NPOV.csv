BANNED BOOKS,Should parents or other adults be able to ban books from schools and libraries?,"Whether parents or adults should ban books is a complex issue, further exacerbated by a significant increase in books challenged in 2021, as tracked by the American Library Association (ALA). The top three reasons cited for challenging materials as reported to the Office of Intellectual Freedom are 1) the material was considered to be “sexually explicit,” 2) the material contained “offensive language,” and 3) the materials was “unsuited to any age group.” Often the argument for challenging books is that parents have the right to decide what material their children are exposed to, such as the three reasons listed above.   However, those opposed to book bans argue that parents restricting which books their kids read also prevents other people from reading banned books, which discourages freedom of thought and deprives students of cultural and historical knowledge. For instance, 46 of the Radcliffe Publishing Group’s “Top 100 Novels of the 20th Century” are frequently challenged. Ultimately, whether parents should ban books or not is a decision that should be made carefully, as explicit materials can be interpreted differently by different people.","https://www.procon.org/headlines/banned-books-top-3-pros-and-cons/

BANNED BOOKS,What are the implications of banning books in schools?,"More than 4 million students in the United States have been affected by book bans. According to a report by PEN America, 138 districts across 34 states have had more than 5,000 books removed from school libraries. Of those books, 41% were related to LGBTQ+ topics, suggesting that the recent book bans may be politically and religiously motivated. Parents and adults who support book bans argue that they should be in control of the material their children consume while their minds are still malleable. However, others argue that the ban is depriving other children of cultural or historical knowledge, despite the First Amendment guaranteeing students the right to learn. Restricting certain books may perpetuate racial and gender discrimination if students are only exposed to certain topics and genres. Regardless of whether people are for or against book bans, there are social implications on the type of materials people are exposed to and the decision will need to be made carefully.","https://www.procon.org/headlines/banned-books-top-3-pros-and-cons/

DEFUND THE POLICE,Defunding the police is so stupid. Why would anyone want that?,"This is a very contentious subject. People who support defunding the police believe the police is overburdened, and many situations they face (mental health crisis, homelessness, barking dogs, drug addiction, teenagers shoplifting etc.) necessitate completely different skills than those required when dealing with more traditional criminal activities. They recommend diverting some of the police budget to pay specialized non-police workers to react to these emergencies, letting the police focus on what they are trained for. People against defunding the police believe the police are currently doing a good job despite their difficult task, and point to the fact that historically, reducing police budget only leads to more crime.","https://www.britannica.com/procon/defund-the-police-debate

DRONE STRIKES OVERSEAS,Is using a drone more effective for dropping bombs?,"Ths US has been using drones (or unmanned aerial vehicals) to carry out strikes on suspected terrorists in other countries. Whether or not drones should be used is a topic of debate. Drones allow the US to attack without sacrificing soliders, resulting in less loss of life and, according to a study done in 2015, less instances of PTSD - the study found that around 4% of drone pilots were considered high risk for PTSD compared to the 12-17% of soldiers who were in active duty in Iraq and Afghanistan. On the other hand, drones don`t target the high level terrorists that they are set out to attack - in 2012, the numbers showed that 2% of drone-related fatalities were those considered militant leaders. They may end up killing civilians or non-war-affiliated individuals. According to CIA documents from 2010-2011, out of 114 drone strikes, 26 targeted “other militants,” meaning that the CIA could not conclusively determine the affiliation of those killed.","https://slideserve.com/varana/wayne-chappelle-psy-d-abpp-kent-mcdonald-col-usaf-mc-fs-neuropsychiatry-branch-usaf-school-of-aerospace-medicine

FREE COLLEGE,Should College be free in the US?,"The discussion over public colleges going tuition-free in the US is far from being a consensus among Americans. A proposal has been created in the US senate in 2021, advocating for free college and stating that it could potentially reduce student debts, which reached 1.76 trillion dollars in 2022 according to the U.S. Federal Reserve Data. Supporters of the bill also highlight that it could decrease inequality, giving the same opportunity of getting a higher education degree for everyone. However, there are opposing views claiming that the tuition-free policy could be harmful. One main argument is that taxpayers would spend billions of dollars on tuition subsidies, while other college costs would remain high. Some also argue that tuition-free college could decrease completion rates, as students would be less engaged.","https://www.britannica.com/procon/free-college-debate

OVER THE COUNTER BIRTH CONTROL PILLS,Should birth control pills be available over the counter?,"Birth control pills, both as a concept and the question of access to it, have long been a topic of conterversary in the United States. There are perscription and non-perscription (aka, over the counter, or OTC) forms of birth control, and with it comes questions over whether or not birth control should be available over the counter. Proponents of OTC birth control say that increased access to birth control would lower the rate of unintended pregnancy, which ends up saving taxpayers - according to one study in 2018, up to $15.5 billion dollars could have been saved by preventing unintending pregnancies. Allowing access to the OTC birth control gives people freedom to make choices that are best for them. Opponents of allowing OTC birth control access say that the ease of availability of birth control will only encourage riskier behavior instead of making people take responsibility for their choices. In addition, it`s estimated that about 27% of people consult their doctor about OTC drugs, which may leave a gap in learning information necessary to make a decision about birth control, which could pose health risks.","https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/contraceptive-use-united-states

PAYING COLLEGE ATHLETES,"If college athletes make so much money for schools, why don't we pay them?","The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) is the non-profit regulating body of college-level student athletes in the US. They make a variety of decisions as it relates to college sports, and one of the more controversial topics in this area relates to paying college athletes. Those who believe college athletes should be paid point to the amount of money that the NCAA and schools themselves receive through college sports and none of that money goes through to the athletes, who are the reason for the sports` successes. In 2017, the NCAA reported 1.06 billion in revenue, none of which went to athletes. Additionally, college athletes are choosing to stay and play in the NCAA instead of pursuing more fervently going into professional play, thus sacrificing their bodies (via injury - in 2017, 61% of D1 athletes reported suffering a major injury) as well as earning potential to play in college and get an education. Those who oppose students being paid state that the NCAA scholarships student athletes often receive (the NCAA has stated they`ve given more than $3.6 billion in scholarship to student athletes) are fair payment for students to be able to play sports and go to school. Also, the chances of going pro are slim (there is about a 1.2% chance that male college football or basketball players will play professionally), and students should focus on their education more than athletics, as their education will take them further. 

As of 2023, no students receive a salary for playing college sports; however, following a Supreme Court case on the subject in 2021, NIL (name, image, likeness) laws allow for sponsorships and other opportunities that student athletes can be paid for.","https://businessofcollegesports.com/tracker-name-image-and-likeness-legislation-by-state/

RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA LEGALIZATION,Why isn't marijuana legal in every state?,"In the United States, the decision to legalize marijuana for recreational purposes is not made at the federal level - it is left to the states. As of September 2023, 24 states have laws legalizing marijuana for recreational purposes, with the rest having varying levels of legality (eg, for medical use but is decriminalized from a non-medical perspective). People have strong opinions on both sides of the aisle when it comes to if marijuana should be legal. Proponents state that legalizing the drug actually makes it safer - taking it off from street dealers (who could be mixing it with other substances) and putting it through a rigorous, government-backed process to make sure it`s suitable for sale. There is also data to show that since legalization (starting with Colorado and Washington in 2012), there`s been a decrease in children`s reported use - 12-18yr olds reported 17% decrease in usage from 2012-2014. Opponents of legalization have cited statistics showing the danger of marijuana being more widely and legally available - after marijuana became legal in 2012, weed-related hospitalizations in Colorado rose 200%, and poison control exposure cases for those under 9 increased 5x. The decision of what people consume and how they do so is personal, and making legislation on substances that are considered riskier come with a lot of considerations.","https://covercannabis.com/blog/where-is-marijuana-legal/

REPARATIONS FOR SLAVERY,Should the US give reparations to descendents of slaves even though they weren't slaves themselves?,"At a high level, reparations are payments (monetary or otherwise) given to those who have suffered harm. Modern US society debates if reparations should be paid to descendents of those who were slaves in the US. This idea has brought about a multitude of opinions. In the 2020s, Americans would have to go back about 5 or 6 generations to confirm if their ancestors were either slave or slave owners, and thus people question why people in modern day would be responsible (or require payment) for actions they are not responsible for. There is also the idea that reparations may actually further divide the country along race lines, if the relationship of repair were reduced to a court case or something more transactional. On the other hand, the detrimental effects of slavery have been passed down through generations, and that divide still exists today in the form of mistreatment and societal inequities. Reparations would help to bring wealth lost through generations of inequity that Black people have lost in America. Also, a framework for reparations already exists: the US paid reparations to victims of Japanese internment camps, and there exists more local instances of this (reparations for Tuskegee syphilis study as well as those forcibly sterilized in North Carolina between 1929 & 1974).",https://www.procon.org/headlines/reparations-for-slavery-top-3-pros-and-cons/,5,1,,,,,,,,,,,,5,5,5,3

However, A 2018 report by the National Academies of Science found that e-cigarettes contain and emit potentially toxic substances, and that youth who use them are at increased risk for cough, wheezing, and asthma exacerbations. E-cigarettes produce a number of dangerous chemicals including acetaldehyde, acrolein, and formaldehyde. These aldehydes can cause lung disease, as well as cardiovascular (heart) disease.

Those who think it should not be a holiday state that it won`t increase voter turnout, as private companies do not have to honor federal holidays, and many low income and blue collar workers (such as retail & hospitality) work in these companies (and sometimes multiple places) and wouldn`t have it off. They note that other methods - such as changing individual company rules around days/time off as well as allowing same day voter registration- would be more effective to increase voter turnout. Those in favor of Election Day being a national holiday state that it would increase voter turnout - in 2016, 14% of eligible voters stated they didn`t vote because they were too busy to make it to the polls.

Proponents of lowering the age state that science shows that 16yr olds have the appropriate decision making ability to be able to vote. Voting earlier also gets people more invested in participating in the democratic process, and research done in 2004 shows that people who participate in elections when they first reach voting age are likely to develop the habit of voting, and those who don’t are more likely to remain nonvoters. Opponents cite that 16 is too young to understand the implilcations of their votes on the future of the country, and that voter turnout in the lower age range is small (12.5% of 18yr olds voted in the 2014 midterms elections), showing that this group of individuals is disinterested in politics and their votes wouldn`t be coming from a place motivated by democracy.",https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/abs/becoming-a-habitual-voter-inertia-resources-and-growth-in-young-adulthood/9EA1F561496D714346491B25B0D52239,4.833333333,1,,,,,,,,,,,,5,4.5,5,3

Banning plastic water bottles would help to reduce exposure to these harmful substances.

It can be used to deter misconduct, as officers may be less likely to engage in illegal or unethical behavior if every action is being recorded. A study done in 2014 in Phoenix, Arizona, after the implementation of body-worn cameras stated that complaints against officers wearing cameras decreased 23%, while complaints against officers not wearing cameras increased 10.6%. However, body cameras can also be useful for police officers` protections, as footage can be used to corroborate the officer`s account of events, or to demonstrate that the officer`s actions were justified.

AMERICAN SOCIALISM,Is socialism bad for America?,"Socialism is a hotly debated topic in the US. There are reasons why people think it would be a successful system instead of the current capitalist structure, and there are reasons why people think it would fail. Those who think it would fail point to statistics that say the American people do not want an economy under socialism, and the lack of desire for it would be a reason for its collapse. In addition, they state that socialist programs that are already in place, such as paid family leave and medicare-for-all, are costing the US a lot of money. Those in favor of socialism state that those socialist policies in place (as well as proposed policies) are very well-liked by the American people, and it stands to reason that expanding that into a governmental structure may actually be a popular choice. They also state that perceived harms created by capitalism (such as the majority of wealth being held  by a minority of people) can be undone with socialist programs working within capitalist structures.",https://www.procon.org/headlines/american-socialism-top-2-pros-and-cons/,4.666666667,1,,,,,,,,,,,,5,4,5,3
COLLEGE EDUCATION,Is college education worth it?,"The debate over whether a college education is worth it is complex, with arguments on both sides.
Many people argue that a college degree does not guarantee a job or a better life. They point out that having a bachelor`s degree used to be rare, but today, nearly four in ten Americans ages 25 and older have a degree. In addition to the increase in degrees, tuition rates have increased faster than income. According to Pew Research, 45% of people with student loan debt say college was not worth the cost and time.
On the other hand, jobs increasingly require higher education. During the 2007 recession, jobs requiring college degrees grew by 187,000, while positions with some college and associate degrees fell by 1.75 million, and positions requiring a high school diploma fell by 5.6 million. People also argue that young adults learn interpersonal and other skills in academia and are more productive members of society. Students who attend in-person classes socialize with people from all over the world and learn from professors with a variety of experiences. Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to go to college is a personal one. There are many factors to consider, such as financial, time, and learning style.

FOSTER CARE,Is foster care what's best for the children?,"Foster care is the temporary placement of children who have been removed from their family`s home for a variety of reasons. As of 2023, almost 400,000 children are in foster care in the US. While the goal of foster care is to protect children, people have debated how the current system is set up in the US and if it`s the best it can be. Proponents of the foster care system state that the system works to keep children in the least stressful situation while going through a traumatizing event - the program aims to keep siblings together and maintain a stable school situation. Placing children in foster care also allows the original parents/guardians to reset their family life so that when reunited with the children, it will be in a stable environment. Opponents of the foster care state that the system is overwhelmed, with an insufficient number of case/social workers to check on a lot of displaced children, which just creates a scenario for people to fall through the cracks. In addition, although foster parents do have to go through an approval process, there are cases where the foster placement situation has turned out to be worse than the original family situation. Regardless of debate, all sides agree that a successful care system must center the children at all costs.","https://adoption.org/positives-negatives-within-foster-care-system

GAY MARRIAGE,Should gay marriage be legal?,"Whether or not gay marriage should be legal has been a topic of intense debate among political figures, religious leaders, and the general public. On June 26, 2015, the Supreme Court ruled that gay marriage is a right protected under the US Constitution. Public opinion on gay marriage has shifted dramatically since 1996, when only 27% of Americans approved of it. Today, 61% of Americans support same-sex marriage. People against gay marriage argue that marriage has traditionally been between a man and a woman, and that civil unions and domestic partnerships could provide the same benefits without changing the definition of marriage. They also argue that gay marriage promotes same-sex relationships in heterosexual culture, which could be detrimental to the LGBTQ+ community. For example, lesbian activist M.V. Lee Badgett, PhD, Director of the Center for Public Policy and Administration at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, says that ""marriage means adopting heterosexual forms of family and giving up distinctively gay family forms and perhaps even gay and lesbian culture."" People in favor of gay marriage argue that denying some people the option to marry is discriminatory, and that gay couples deserve the same rights and benefits as heterosexual couples. They also argue that denying gay couples the right to marry would make them second-class citizens. As People for the American Way explains, ""As a legal matter, marriage is a civil institution…Marriage is also a religious institution, defined differently by different faiths and congregations."" However, civil law has always been supreme in defining what marriage is, rather than religious law. Regardless of your stance on gay marriage, it is important to consider the various factors and personal decisions that make this topic so complex.","https://gaymarriage.procon.org/

GMO,Are Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO) foods bad for you?,"The debate on whether GMOs are bad for you has been strongly argued among scientists and the general public. Humans have modified foods for thousands of years by cross-breeding certain crops to create new breeds. Today, genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are created in a lab where researchers edit the plant`s DNA structure. Major foods, such as corn and soybeans, are nearly all genetically modified. People who argue that GMOs are not bad for you point to the fact that GMO foods are often modified to be resistant to pesticides, which means that farmers do not have to use as many chemicals to get rid of insects. In addition, growing GMO crops uses fewer resources, such as water and land, and farmers can grow more with less. On the other hand, other people disapprove of GMOs because they may increase antibiotic resistance. People who consume these modified plants may also digest the antibiotic gene, which could cause a shift in their gut microbiome. There is also the argument that these types of crops can cause allergic reactions in people who were previously not allergic to them. Ultimately, there are benefits and drawbacks to consuming GMO foods, and it is a personal choice.","https://www.insider.com/guides/health/diet-nutrition/gmo-pros-and-cons#:~:text=GMO%20foods%20are%20designed%20to,reactions%20or%20increased%20antibiotic%20resistance.",4.666666667,1,,,,,,,,,,,,5,5,4,3
ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION,What is the core of the debate around illegal immigration?,"Undocumented (or illegal) US immigration is often debated, as people from other countries seek residence in the US for a variety of reasons. Some people enter the US without a path to becoming a citizen, and there are differing opinions on this kind of immigration as well as options for undocumented individuals. There are people who believe that anyone who enters the US without paperwork are committing a crime and should be sent back, as that sends a message that crime is not tolerated and will discourage people in the future from coming to the US illegally. There are those who believe that undocumented immigrants should be given a path to citizenship, sanctioned by the government, so that they can participate in all aspects of American life: many immigrants have come over as children (anywhere from 1.5-3.6 million children, according to estmates from the DACA program), when they wouldn`t have known it was illegal, and thus deserve a chance.","https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/043015/pros-cons-immigration-reform.asp

POLICE BRUTALITY,Is police brutality a problem in the US?,"The belief that police in the US are using undue force when responding to incidents (more colloquially known as police brutality) has been a heated topic. There are those who believe this is a large issue in society, and there are those who do not think this is an issue at all. Statistics show that police violence is a leading cause of death for young men of color, with Black men in particular having a 1 in 1,000 chance of being killed by police in their lifetime (as opposed to 1 in 2,000 for all men and 1 in 33,000 for all women). The United Nations Human Rights Committee issued a report in 2006 stating that the rise in police violence is an after effect of the war on terror - they stated that the War on Terror “created a generalized climate of impunity for law enforcement officers, and contributed to the erosion of what few accountability mechanisms exist for civilian control over law enforcement agencies. As a result, police brutality and abuse persist unabated and undeterred across the country.”  On the other hand, there  is no clear line between what is brutality and what is considered an appropriate use of force in a given situation. Being in law enforcement is a dangerous position - police officers dying in the line of duty has increased 59% from 2020 to 2021, and police have a right to protect their life when faced with a threat, which may include the use of force.","https://academicinfluence.com/inflection/controversial-topics/controversial-topic-police-brutality#:~:text=Those%20who%20believe%20that%20police,nature%20of%20law%20enforcement%20requires

In addition to increasing knowledge, zoos protect animals from extinction. For example, Corroboree frogs, eastern bongos, and regent honeyeaters have all been saved from extinction by zoos. On the other hand, others argue that zoos are psychologically damaging to animals. A variety of animals display physiological issues, such as teeth grinding in captured orcas due to stress and tigers given Valium for severe agitation. There is also the argument that zoos do not educate the public enough to justify keeping animals in captivity.

BANNED BOOKS,Should parents or other adults be able to ban books from schools and libraries?,"According to the American Library Association (ALA), there has been a significant increase in the number of books challenged in 2021. This has led to an intense debate about whether parents or adults should ban books. Those who argue against banning books say that restricting access to these materials can prevent other people from reading them. They also argue that banning books discourages freedom of thought and deprives people of cultural and historical knowledge. Moreover, studies have found that books can increase awareness and empathy for people with different life experiences. Those who support book bans argue that the challenged titles are sexually explicit, contain offensive language, or are unsuitable for any age group. They often believe that they have the right to decide what material their children are exposed to. Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to ban books is a complex one that should be made carefully.

Recording police encounters with citizens can expose private medical conditions, such as mental illnesses or illicit substance abuses. It can also traumatize victims of domestic violence, triggering them later. It is also possible that recordings can put informants and witnesses at risk. On the other hand, there are many supporters of body-worn camera use by Police officers. Some arguments include the increase in police accountability or the reduction of reports of police misconduct. Moreover, the footage from body cameras can be used to corroborate the officer`s account of events, or to show that the officer`s actions were justified.

The program was implemented in 75% of the K-12 schools in the U.S. as a drug prevention measure. The old D.A.R.E. curriculum was replaced by “Keepin It Real” (KiR) in 2009 with a more inclusive and realistic curriculum.

In addition to preventing drug use, D.A.R.E. is certified as an “evidence-based substance abuse prevention program” by the US Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). However, other people argue that the curriculum doesn’t prevent substance abuse in elementary, middle or high school. A national study done by the the Department of Justice concluded that there the effects of the education are small and it’s significantly less successful at preventing drug use than other programs. Also 70% of the students reported neutral to negative sentiments post completion of D.A.R.E.

Those who believe that creationism has a place being taught in public schools point to shortcomings and inconsistencies in evolution that are left a mystery without other explanation.

In addition, unions provide formal processes for complaints and disputes that help to bring about a more fair process than if nothing exists. On the other hand, unions can make it hard to promote strong workers and fire not-so-strong workers due to their strong reliance on seniority as being important. Also, unions require fees that must be paid (even if someone joins an organization as a non-union employee but then is later made to join union through policy), which can present difficulties for people.

Banning plastic water bottles would help to reduce exposure to these harmful substances.

CHURCHES AND TAXES,Why don't churches pay taxes if we all have to pay ?,"American churches have been tax-exempt for over 200 years. One of the reasons why Churches earn their tax exemption is by contributing to the public good through offering numerous social services to people in need, including soup kitchens, homeless shelters, after school programs for poor families, and assistance to victims of domestic violence. These efforts relieve the government of doing work it would otherwise be obliged to undertake. However, many churches have taken advantage of the tax exemption to enrich their leaders. supporting the extravagant lifestyles of wealthy pastors. The U.S. Senate has launched an investigation into some religious groups in Nov. 2007 after receiving complaints of church revenue being used to buy pastors private jets, luxury cars and multimillion-dollar homes.","https://www.britannica.com/procon/churches-and-taxes-debate

While this may seem like a direct response to public pressure, body cameras also protect officers from allegations, hold them to a higher professional standard, and provide evidence in high-stress situations.

PRIVATE PRISONS,Do private prisons save money,"Whether private prisons can save government money is a complex issue with varying factors to consider. Private prisons may save government money if the current government-run facility charges more per prison than a private facility. The government may be incentivized to transfer expensive prisoners to a private facility if they’re able to save per prisoner headcount. However, there are economics behind prisoners that will need to be considered. If a corporate-run prison decides to further cut costs to increase profit, it may come at the expense of the prisoners. For example, if the goal is to reduce daily costs, certain programs or cleaning services may be reduced which can potentially create an unsanitary environment if there is a high prison population.  Ultimately, determining whether private prisons save government money is complex and will need to consider factors outside of cost savings.","https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/062215/business-model-private-prisons.asp#:~:text=As%20of%202019%2C%20there%20are,a%20public%20facility%20would%20cost.",4.4,1,,,,,,,,5,5,5,4,3,,,5

Lots of questions have risen regarding an individual`s personal responsibility to maintain their health. One of the main topics of debate is if obesity is classified as a disease rather than a result of deliberate choices made by the individual. According to the American Medical Association`s definition of a disease, obesity meets the criteria, and there is evidence that obesity can be caused by genetic factors beyond one`s control. On the other hand, arguments have been made that obesity is considered a risk factor that can be preventable for other, actual diseases, and that more oftentimes that not, obesity is caused be lifestyle choices (such as dietary choices and sedentary lifestyle).

Research has shown that consuming a lot of porn can reduce the amount of grey matter in the brain, which would have the effect of desensitizing people and reducing their decision-making capabilities. Porn has been shown to have an addictive quality in the way that gambling and drinking/drugs can - leading to risky behavior to get a fix. On the other side of the debate, studies have shown that couples who watch porn together report an increased sense of intimacy and that with the advent of ethical porn showing different kinds of bodies and interactions, people are starting to report they feel more comfortable with their bodies after seeing themselves represented. What media people consume and how they consume is a personal choice guided by age approrpriate laws and tolerance levels.

SOCIAL SECURITY PRIVATIZATION,Is US social security stronger as a public program or should it go private?,"The social security system as it stands in the United States is a retirement system that pays US workers who have paid into the system throughout their labour-producing years. In 2019, the system accounted for about 1 trillion dollars in spending (roughly 23%) of total US federal spending. With the rising age of the “Baby Boomer” generation, the system has been paying out more than it’s been collecting, and it`s estimated that the social security trust fund will run out by 2035, leading people to debate whether or not the system should be privatized. 

Those who believe it should be privatized cite the urgency of a solution needed before the system runs out, and continuing along the government route would lead to cuts in other programs such as benefits or result in greater tax hikes. In addition, they state there is more potential in private retirement accounts, with the potential to participate in the stock market and reap its benefits.

Those against privatization said that changing  the current system would actually make the problem worse, as now people would have more of their payroll taxes going to private accounts, thus shrinking the social security trust fund at a fast rate. They also state that participation in the stock market could result in huge losses, and retirement funds can’t afford that gamble. ","https://socialsecurity.procon.org/

In 2013, the hashtag #BlackLiveMatter was used on social media to bring awareness to the acquittal of George Zimmerman after shooting of an African American teenager, Trayvon Martin. As more African Americans became the target of police brutality (including the deaths of more innocents), the movement grew to attract attention to the specific discriminations and violence this community faces.  After the death of George Floyd in 2020, the movement gained a new momentum.   There have been many reactions to the Black Lives Matter movement. Some people argue that all lives are equal, and the slogan All Lives Matter was created in response to the Black Lives Matter movement. Another slogan, Blue Lives Matter, was created to attract attention to the police officers who also lost their lives.

Proponents of this law think that by commiting those heinous crimes, felons have broken the social contract and lost their right to be participating in the society. Moreover, they think that felons have showed poor judgement once, so we cannot trust their opinions. On the other hand, supporters of felon voting believe that felons have paid for their crimes, and should be reinserted in the society.

However, others would argue that the Second Amendment of the United States Constitution protects individual gun ownership, gun control laws do not deter crime, and gun control laws infringe upon the right to self-defense.

It gives people a livable wage, which reduces poverty, and allows people to spend more money which in turn helps the economy. The main argument against increasing it is that businesses may not be able to afford to pay their workers more, so they will have to hire less people, which means that more people will be unemployed.

WAR ON DRUGS,The war on drugs is the only path towards salvation. Please tell me you're on our side.,"The war on drugs is the effort to suppress the use of illegal drugs in the US.

On the one hand, those in favor of it believe it`s necessary to reduce crime by reducing the availability of drugs and therefore the incentive to commit crime to buy it.

Those who do not believe the ACLU is doing good for the country state that they are too politically motivated and favor civil rights for some groups (such as criminals) at the expense of others (such as religious groups).

Proponents of animal dissection state there is no alternative for learning about the body of a given animal than actually looking inside the animal, whereas those opposed state that with the advent of advance technology, there exists a realistic alternative that does not involve the loss of life.

CORPORAL PUNISHMENT,Should corporal punishment be used in schools?,"The debate on whether corporal punishment should be used in schools is a sensitive topic with opinions on both sides of the argument. Corporal punishment is inflicting physical pain on a person’s body as punishment. In the U.S., nineteen out of fifty states legally permit corporal punishment in schools. People in favor of corporal punishment argue that it is useful for behavioral issues when used in moderation, and that the negative effects of physical punishment are from its prolonged and excessive use. They also say that corporal punishment sets clear boundaries and motivates children to behave better in school. However, others argue that the harm outweighs the benefits of corporal punishment. Oftentimes, children endure long-lasting physical and mental effects of physical harm, such as anxiety, depression, substance abuse, or stress later in life. In addition to individual harm, physical force can create an unsafe and violent school environment that may put students at risk of bullying and physical abuse from teachers and other students. Ultimately, whether schools allow corporal punishment or not, there are psychological, physical, and environmental factors that will need to be considered when making a decision.","https://connectusfund.org/18-corporal-punishment-pros-and-cons

DEFUND THE POLICE,Why do some people want to defund the police?,"The phrase ""defund the police"" can take on a variety of meanings, but at its base, the idea is to take funding that police would normally receive and move that funding (as well as the work) to more community oriented resources. This calls into the question the role of the police in community, and this has sparked debate on this issue. Those in favor of moving to defund the police state that currently, policing was never made to handle all the events that they are tasked with handling, and that activities such as mental health and crisis intervensions should be handled by experts in that area. In addition, they believe policing has had an adverse effect on communities of colour, and reducing the funding would stop overpolicing those areas, which they see as a benefit to advancing those communities.

Those opposed to defunding the police state that doing so will cause crime to increase substantially as there will not be a program in place to catch and prosecute crimes. If anything, opponents state that police reform is a path to take so that policing can still keep communities safe, but do it by more uniform standards across the country.","https://www.britannica.com/procon/defund-the-police-debate

There is a  lot of debate as to whether or not feminism is actually achieving that goal. Those against feminism believe that the movement teaches women to hate men and disregard any criticism from men as misogynist. They also state that feminism is partly responsible for the destruction of traditional family roles by making it easier to get divorced and adopt children as a single parent. Those for feminism have stated the ways in which the movement has improved conditions for women, from allowing women the right to vote, to striving for equal pay in the workplace to their male counterparts.","https://environmental-conscience.com/feminism-pros-cons/

VIDEO GAMES AND VIOLENCE,Is there an effect of violent video games on children?,"As of 2023, over 80% of video games contain some sort of violence, and 97% of teens have stated that they play video games. Kids/teens’ exposure to violent media is a polarizing subject in the US. Those who believe there is a relationship state that exposure to violence via video games desensitizes them to real-world violence such that they don’t realize their impact when they start imitating that behavior. Those who believe no relationship exists cite data showing that violent crime isn’t actually on the rise despite exponential growth in sales/downloads of violent video games, and state that there are inherent personality factors that may predispose kids/teens to be susceptible to imitating the violent action in video games. What, when, and how kids/teens are exposed to any kind of media has typically been decided by those in charge of those children, but with the advent of technology and social media, the variety of violent media exposure expands beyond video games and can happen at ages earlier than those in charge of the children may be comfortable with.","https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/violent-video-games-and-young-people

This is a concern for many Americans - a 2018 study showed that about 80% of Americans believed the current voting system may be “vulnerable to hackers.”  On the other hand, voting machine technology does go through a rigorous testing process to protect against hackers.

LGBT ADOPTION RIGHTS,Should gay people allowed to adopt?,"As of 2017, it is legal for gay people & couples to adopt in all 50 states, but the controversy over whether or not they should be able to adopt continues. Proponents of gay adoption cite studies from the American Psychological Association (APA) that show there is no evidence that growing up in a gay household produces a worse outcome for an adopted child than growing up in a heterosexual household, and that children are equally well adjusted and aren`t at an increased risk for abuse. Those opposed to gay marriage  state that having gay parents puts the child at risk for social ostracization, which makes it hard to adjust.

PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICES,Should the U.S. Government regulate high drug prices?,"Government regulation of drug prices is a complex issue with a lot of factors at play. Some people argue that the government should regulate drug prices because it would save money for governments, employers, and consumers. More importantly, many people depend on life saving drugs and often have to take on debt or forgo taking medication due to cost. According to Truth in Rx, an American Medical Association campaign for drug price transparency, “[p]rescription drug price increases can lead some patients to not be able to afford critical medicine…. The result? Among this group, three in ten say their condition got worse.” Others argue that government regulation may inhibit innovation, leading to less research and development (R&D) and new drugs. David A. Ricks CEO of drug company Eli Lilly says “Policy makers need to focus on fixing broken health [insurance] plan designs that shift too much cost to the sick in order to lower premiums for the healthy.” Expanding access to affordable insurance by covering a large percentage of prescription drug costs. Ultimately, whether the U.S. government should regulate drug prices is a decision that should be made carefully, considering all of the factors involved.","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31248779/

US – IRAQ WAR,Why did the US get involved in the Iraq war?,"The United States` decision to enter the Iraq War was a complex one, with a variety of factors contributing to the decision.  One of the primary reasons for the war was the belief that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction (WMDs). In 1998, the United States and its allies had launched Operation Desert Fox, a bombing campaign against Iraq, in response to Iraq`s refusal to cooperate with UN weapons inspectors. The inspectors were unable to find any WMDs, but the Bush administration continued to believe that Iraq possessed them. In his 2003 State of the Union address, President George W. Bush declared that Iraq had ""a stockpile of biological and chemical weapons that could be used with abandon"" and that the country was ""continuing to develop nuclear weapons.""  Another major factor in the decision to go to war was the belief that Saddam Hussein was a threat to the United States and its allies. Hussein had a history of using chemical weapons against his own people, and he was seen as a potential supporter of terrorism. The Bush administration believed that Hussein was developing WMDs in order to use them against the United States or its allies, or to sell them to terrorist groups.  Finally, the war was also seen as a way to promote democracy in the Middle East. The Bush administration believed that the removal of Hussein would lead to a more democratic and stable Iraq, which would in turn help to spread democracy throughout the region.  There were also a number of dissenting voices who argued against the war. Some people believed that the war was unnecessary, as there was no imminent threat from Iraq. Others argued that the war would be counterproductive, as it would destabilize the region and lead to more violence.  Ultimately, the decision to go to war was a difficult one, with no easy answers. The Bush administration believed that the war was necessary to protect the United States from a dangerous threat, while critics argued that the war was unnecessary and would be counterproductive. The war had a significant impact on the United States and the Middle East, and its legacy is still being debated today.","https://www.britannica.com/event/Iraq-War

In addition, they feel it`s government overreach to make people do something that should be a personal decision. Proponents of this concept say that it will help people - giving access to healthcare for everyone will make a healthier, more productive society.

In addition, restorative justice measures are cheaper than incarceration, so it would be less costly to taxpayers. Opponents cite the participation aspect that`s required on the victim`s part - for this program to work, both sides must be willing to ""come to the table"" to talk, and that may be a lot for the victim to relive trauma, and it may be the case that the offender would not want to engage in dialogue with the victim.

DACA & DREAMERS,Should children of illegal immigrants get sent back to their parents' home country?,"There are strong arguments on both sides of the issue of whether or not children of undocumented immigrants should be deported back to their country.  On the one hand, some people believe that it is unfair to punish children for the actions of their parents. They argue that these children are innocent and have no control over their immigration status. They also point out that deporting children would disrupt their education and uproot them from their homes and communities.  On the other hand, some people believe that it is important to enforce immigration laws. They argue that allowing children of undocumented immigrants to stay in the country would encourage more illegal immigration. They also worry that these children will become a drain on public resources, such as education and healthcare.  Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to deport children of undocumented immigrants is a complex one. There are no easy answers, and any decision will have far-reaching consequences.

For example, restricting certain books may perpetuate racial and gender discrimination if students are only exposed to certain topics and genres. However, parents and adults argue that they should be in control of material their children consume, especially while their minds are still malleable. For example topics such as violence, sexually explicit, and offensive language might not be suitable for young children.

The movement grew and attracted more attention on police violence and discrimination as more cases of police brutality increased. After the death of George Floyd in 2020, the movement gained new momentum with strong reactions from many people. Some people argue that all lives are equal, thus the slogan All Lives Matter was created in response to the Black Lives Matter movement. Similarly, Blue Lives Matter was created in response to the police officers who also lost their lives on duty. People in these movements consider the Black Lives Matter movement to be anti-police and believe the attention towards racial violence is disproportionate compared to other social issues.

OBESITY,Should the food industry be responsible for the rise of obesity?,"The food industry has been a major contributor to the rise of obesity in the United States. The overconsumption of processed foods, high in sugar, salt, and unhealthy fats, has led to a dramatic increase in the number of people who are overweight or obese. The food industry has been criticized for its role in this epidemic, and some people believe that it should be held responsible for the health problems that have resulted.  There are a number of reasons why the food industry is seen as a contributing factor to obesity. First, processed foods are often designed to be highly palatable and addictive. They are often full of sugar, salt, and unhealthy fats, which can lead to overeating. Second, the food industry has a strong influence on the way we eat. Food advertising is ubiquitous, and it often promotes unhealthy foods. Third, the food industry has lobbied against regulations that would make it more difficult for people to eat unhealthy foods.  Despite the criticism, there are also those who believe that the food industry is not solely responsible for the rise of obesity. They argue that individual choices and genetics also play a role. They also point out that the food industry is responding to consumer demand for unhealthy foods.  Ultimately, the responsibility for obesity is complex. There is no single cause, and no single solution. However, the food industry does have a role to play in addressing this issue. It can make healthier foods more affordable and accessible, and it can reduce its marketing of unhealthy foods.

ACLU,How much influence should ACLU have in the federal government?,"The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) is a non-profit organization that fights for the rights of all Americans, regardless of race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, or national origin. The ACLU has been a major player in the fight for civil rights since its founding in 1920, and has played a key role in many landmark cases, including Brown v. Board of Education and Roe v. Wade.  The ACLU has a long history of working with the federal government to protect civil rights. In the 1960s, the ACLU worked with the Kennedy administration to pass the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. In the 1970s, the ACLU worked with the Nixon administration to pass the Freedom of Information Act. In the 1980s, the ACLU worked with the Reagan administration to pass the Americans with Disabilities Act.  The ACLU has also been critical of the federal government when it has violated civil rights. In the 1950s, the ACLU opposed the McCarthy hearings, which led to the blacklisting of suspected communists. In the 1960s, the ACLU opposed the Vietnam War. In the 1970s, the ACLU opposed the Watergate scandal.  The ACLU has a strong track record of fighting for civil rights, and has played a major role in shaping the American legal landscape. The ACLU is a valuable ally of the federal government in the fight for civil rights, and its influence should be welcomed.  However, some people believe that the ACLU has too much influence in the federal government. They argue that the ACLU is too often aligned with liberal political causes, and that its agenda does not reflect the views of all Americans. They also argue that the ACLU is too quick to sue the government, and that its litigation tactics can be disruptive and counterproductive.  These concerns are valid, and it is important to ensure that the ACLU does not have too much influence in the federal government. However, it is also important to recognize the ACLU`s important role in protecting civil rights. The ACLU is a valuable ally of the federal government in the fight for civil rights, and its influence should be welcomed.  Ultimately, the question of how much influence the ACLU should have in the federal government is a complex one. There are valid arguments on both sides of the issue.

VIDEO GAMES AND VIOLENCE,Do violent video games make kids/teens violent?,"As of 2023, over 80% of video games contain some sort of violence, and 97% of teens have stated that they play video games. There are plenty of studies researching a potential link between violence in video games and violence in kids/teens, and the findings of the research differ greatly. Regardless of research findings, it`s hard to ignore the rise in violence in younger and younger kids, and the increase in more and more violent video games. 
Exposure to violence via video games desensitizes them to real-world violence such that they don’t realize their impact when they start imitating that behaviour. And while instances of aggression in school age kids vis a vis bullying is decreasing (from 28% in 2009 to 22% in 2019), there is a rise in school shootings (from 38 violent school deaths in 2016 to 75 shootings in 2019), a bigger display of violence than bullying. 
We can`t totally control what, when, and how kids/teens are exposed to any kind of media, but with the advent of more advance, realistic technology in video games, and the invention of social media, the variety of violent media exposure expands beyond video games and can happen at any age and is clearly having an effect on how kids react to situations.","https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/violent-video-games-and-young-people

A felony is the most serious class of crime that one can commit - it shows that they cannot operate within the bounds of society and have failed to uphold their responsibilities as citizens, and thus should lose the rights that come with that - that fits the crime. In the 14th Amendment, the amendment includes the caveat that the “right to vote” may be “​abridged … for participation in rebellion, or other crime.

Workers should join and stay with a company whose management they trust, and shouldn`t have to feel that things need to be formally negotiated through a separate party that may not understand the nuances of that specific company. The union at the day is also a business with its own interest, needs, and desire for profits, so it actually makes it hard to trust that unions are doing things in the best interest of the workers. Lastly, at the end of the day, there is no guarantee that unions will make contracts better - things could go awry in negotiations that would end in terms that may not actually favour workers, but represents that ""best deal"" that unions could get, instead of employees working directly with their management.","https://smartasset.com/career/the-pros-and-cons-of-unions

ABORTION,Should abortion be legal in the US?,"Abortion needs to be solidified as legal in the US (and the world) forever. There are many reasons why we need to legalize this: here are four of them. One: we need to keep it safe. It`s not like banning abortion will stop abortions from happening: it`ll just push those seeking abortion ""underground"" to unsafe measures. Because abortion is a taboo subject and reporting requirements vary by state, it`s hard to get data on how many abortions happen each year - the best estimate from a recent research study states that 930,160 abortions were performed in the US in 2020, which represents an 8% increase from 2017. If all these abortions were to be preformed illegally, they`d be subject to unsafe measures and likely cost a lot of money, none of which would be covered by any kind of health insurance. Two: there are cases where abortion is medically necessary to save the life of the person who is carrying the child - conditions such as preeclampsia and placental abruptions could cause death if the pregnancy continues. In addition, there are cases when the birthing person has cancer, and their cancer may not be able to be effectively treated while pregnant. Three: it can be proven that there are cases where the fetus will not survive after birth, or that they will not survive long-term and be in constant suffering, and in that case, the most humane thing to do would be to end the pregnancy. Four: healthcare should be a human right, and abortion is a form of healthcare. We shouldn`t have to argue that people should have the autonomy and access to make the best decisions for their bodies and lives, as it doesn`t affect anyone else, least of all the people protesting its legality. Hopefully the medically necessary reasons listed above should be taken into consideration by all, even if reason four listed should be the base of our treatment of abortion.","https://www.guttmacher.org/article/2022/11/abortion-incidence-and-service-availability-united-states-2020

EUTHANASIA & ASSISTED SUICIDE,Should the US legalize assisted suicide on the national level?,"The topic of allowing humans the choice to end their life in the face of terminal illness has been a contested subject in the US since the early 1900s, but it really shouldn`t be. Poll data in 2018 suggests that a majority (72%) of Americans support physician-assisted suicide/euthanasia, but opposing opinions keep this topic one of debate. Those making the decision should be the person in control - they have a right to choose how they live, and that right should extend to how they die. In addition, those who are making that decision are doing it because they know that only more suffering is in the future - suffering they do not want. There isn`t any data to support that people are asking for euthanasia just because they want it on a whim, and laws would ensure that those pursuing this path would do so with a doctor and that there is no other option (other than suffering and pain for however long one has left).","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assisted_suicide_in_the_United_States

The homeschool system is virtually unregulated, so untrained individuals can homeschool, which puts child at risk of falling behind academically and socially. Just because someone can have children or talk to them doesn`t mean they understand how children learn and can do the best by them to give them what they need to be successful in the world. In addition, homeschool makes it easy to mask child abuse via keeping kids at home all the time.","https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=91
